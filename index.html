        <b><p>Wikipedia says:</p></b>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheez-It">
          <em><q>Cheez-It crackers are 26-by-24-millimetre (1.0 by 0.94 in) rectangles, though they are often believed to be squares. Cheez-It crackers are made with actual cheese, and are marketed by Kellogg's as such. The original Cheez-It was the only product available until the 1980s; since then, have been over 50 different varieties of Cheez-It flavors and products.</q></em>
